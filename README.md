# Staircase Paradox Visualization

This project demonstrates the **Staircase Paradox** using a Python program with an interactive graphical interface. The paradox highlights the difference between the perceived length of a jagged path (a staircase) and the hypotenuse of a triangle as the staircase becomes increasingly detailed.

----------

## What is the Staircase Paradox?

The Staircase Paradox occurs when the hypotenuse of a right triangle is replaced by a jagged staircase. As the number of steps in the staircase increases, the path length of the staircase approaches infinity, while the hypotenuse length remains constant. This paradox challenges our intuition about lengths and distances in geometry.

In this visualization, we use a 3-4-5 right triangle as the base example and show how replacing the hypotenuse with increasingly detailed staircases leads to surprising results.

## Features of the Program

### Interactive Buttons:

1.  **Add Step:** Increase the number of steps in the staircase, making it more detailed.

2.  **Remove Step:** Decrease the number of steps in the staircase.

3.  **Reset Steps:** Reset the staircase to its initial state with a single step.

### Visual Elements:

-   The **green triangle** represents the original 3-4-5 triangle.

-   The **blue staircase** shows the jagged path replacing the hypotenuse.

-   The **red dashed line** is the original hypotenuse for comparison.
